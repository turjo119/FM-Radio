# ARDUINO FM RADIO 

### In this project I build an FM radio using an Arduino Uno, a TEA5767 FM radio module, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a few other components. The radio is controlled by a rotary encoder and a potentiometer, one for changing the frequency and the other for changing the volume. There is also a MAX7219 LED dot Matrix display which shows the current Radio station. The radio can be powered by a 9V battery or a 5V USB power supply.

### A list of the components used in this project:
- Arduino Nano
- TEA5767 FM Radio Module
- MAX7219 LED Dot Matrix Display
- KY-040 Rotary Encoder
- PAM8403 Audio Amplifier
- 10K Potentiometer
- 3.5mm Audio Jack
- 5V USB Power Supply
- Speakers
