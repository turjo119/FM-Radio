# ARDUINO FM RADIO 

### In this project I build an FM radio using an Arduino Uno, a TEA5767 FM radio module, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a few other components. The radio is controlled by a rotary encoder and a potentiometer, one for changing the frequency and the other for changing the volume. There is also a MAX7219 LED dot Matrix display which shows the current Radio station. The radio can be powered by a 9V battery or a 5V USB power supply.

A video of the project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZRx7C7gTdg)

Detailed instruction, schmatics and explanation on how to build the radio coming soon...
